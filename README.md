## 🧠 Mind Reader Game  

### 🎯 Overview  
**Mind Reader Game** is a simple yet fun prediction game built using **React Native**. The game presents the user with a list of **10 cricket players** and asks them to pick one in their mind. Through a series of **three questions**, where the user selects **Yes** or **No**, the game predicts the chosen player.  

🔢 The prediction is based on a **numerical calculation** of how many times the user presses "Yes."  

### 🚀 Features  
✅ **Minimalistic UI** – Focused on simple gameplay  
✅ **Quick 3-step guessing process**  
✅ **No extra features** – Designed for Play Store publishing practice  

### 📌 How It Works  
1. The user sees a list of **10 cricket players**.  
2. They **choose a player in their mind**.  
3. The game shows **three different small lists** (each containing some of the original 10 players).  
4. The user answers **Yes/No** based on whether their player is in each list.  
5. After **three questions**, the game **predicts** the player's choice.  

### 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **React Native**  
- **JavaScript**  

### 🎮 Motivation  
The primary goal of this project was to **publish an app on the Play Store** as a learning experience. The app was kept as simple as possible to **focus on the publishing process** rather than complex features.  

Unfortunately, the **college department's Play Store account** got suspended due to inactivity a few months ago. However, the project remains a **valuable learning experience** in app deployment.  

### 🏆 Future Improvements  
- Adding **more player choices**  
- Implementing **animations & sounds**  
- Improving the **prediction algorithm**
